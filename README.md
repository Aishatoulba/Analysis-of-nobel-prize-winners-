Hello there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="10px"> 
This project is a datacamp practice project that I have done while studying the data scientist with R track :)

## 👀 Scenario

The Nobel prize is the world's most well known scientific award. Apart from the honor , prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.



## 🎯 Objective 

In this project , I'll be analyzing a dataset containing information about nobel prize winners. The dataset includes details such as prize category, prize share , full name of the prize winner among other details. Our project will consist of the following steps:

📊 Data collection: The data is collected from Datacamp.

🧹Data inspection: checking the data types , missing values etc..

🕵️‍♂️ Exploratory data analysis: We'll analyze the data to understand




 ## ⚙️ Process:
  1. **Setting up our working environment**: Github repository & Jupyter Notebook 
  2. **Data Inspection**: Data understanding , checking data types and missing values
  3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
